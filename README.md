# env-plus

Set of simple scripts, that help to manage python environments:

- `mkenv env` - creates an environment with name "env" in `$ENVS` folder
- `rmenv env` - removes an environment with name "env" from `$ENVS` folder
- `runenv env` - activates an environment with name "env"
- `addenv env` - attaches an environment with name "env" to the current one (makes all packages from "env" visible in the current one)
- `subenv env` - detches an environment with name "env" from the current one
